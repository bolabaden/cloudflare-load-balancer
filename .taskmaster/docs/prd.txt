2. **Implement Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests for all components and utilities
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Performance and security testing
   - Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

3. **Enhance GitHub Workflows**
   - Automated testing on pull requests
   - Deployment automation for staging and production
   - Security scanning and vulnerability checks
   - Performance monitoring and reporting

4. **Secure the System**
   - Implement robust authentication and authorization
   - Add rate limiting and DDoS protection
   - Secure API endpoints with proper validation
   - Implement audit logging and monitoring

   - Session management
   - Activity audit trails

### API Features
1. **RESTful API Design**
   - CRUD operations for all resources
   - Proper HTTP status codes
   - Consistent error handling
   - API versioning support

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - WebSocket connections for live data
   - Server-sent events for notifications
   - Efficient data synchronization

3. **Security Endpoints**
   - Authentication and token management
   - User session handling
   - Audit log access

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Structure**: Atomic design principles
- **State Management**: Centralized store with proper data flow
- **API Layer**: Abstracted service layer with error handling
