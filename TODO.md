# Cloudflare Load Balancer TODO List

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

- [x] Round-robin load balancing with weighted distribution
- [x] Session affinity via IP hashing
- [x] Request proxying with header preservation
- [x] Durable Object state management
- [x] Dynamic backend configuration
- [x] Timeouts and retry logic
- [x] Passive health checks
- [x] Active health checks
- [x] Metrics collection and API
- [x] Admin API endpoints

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### High Priority

- [ ] Rate limiting per backend
- [ ] Advanced routing rules (path-based, header-based)
- [ ] Webhook notifications for health status changes
- [ ] Historical metrics storage
- [ ] SSL certificate validation

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Geographic routing (geo-based backend selection)
- [ ] Load-based routing (least connections, least response time)
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- [ ] API key management for admin access
- [ ] Audit logging

### Low Priority

- [ ] WebSocket support
- [ ] gRPC support
- [ ] Multi-region deployment
- [ ] Configuration import/export
- [ ] Dashboard UI (if needed)

## üêõ Known Issues

- [ ] Session affinity cookies not implemented (IP-based only)
- [ ] No persistent metrics storage (in-memory only)
- [ ] Limited error reporting in admin API

## üìù Notes

This is a minimal, production-ready load balancer focused on core functionality. The codebase has been significantly simplified by removing OAuth authentication, web interface, and complex configuration management in favor of a clean, maintainable API-first approach.
