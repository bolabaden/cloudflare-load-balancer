## âœ… **Core Load Balancer Features (Existing)**

### âœ… 1. **Round-Robin Algorithm Core**

* [x] Implement round-robin index tracking (incrementing per request, modulo backend list length).
* [x] Handle concurrency safely (atomic updates, especially across multiple instancesâ€”Durable Object helps here).
* [ ] Support weighted round-robin (optional but useful).

### âœ… 2. **Session Stickiness (Affinity)**

* [x] Support session stickiness via:
  * [x] Cookies (e.g., `X-Backend-Id`)
  * [x] IP hashing fallback (e.g., for non-cookie clients like APIs)
* [x] Allow configuring sticky vs. non-sticky routing per route or domain.

### âœ… 3. **Request Proxying**

* [x] Forward all relevant headers (esp. `Host`, `Authorization`, cookies).
* [x] Rewrite `Host` header or preserve based on backend type (important for virtual hosting).
* [x] Handle streaming (chunked requests/responses, WebSockets, SSE).
* [x] Preserve HTTP methods and bodies (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/etc.).
* [x] Normalize and validate URLs to avoid open proxy issues.

### âœ… 4. **Resilience & State**

* [x] Use Durable Object for:
  * [x] Persisting the backend list and round-robin pointer.
  * [x] Managing concurrent access to index.
* [x] Implement fallback strategy for overflow cases (e.g., if all backends are unreachable, but this is borderline devops).

### âœ… 5. **Backend List Management**

* [x] Allow dynamic backend registration/removal (hot updates).
* [x] Support static configuration fallback.
* [x] Ensure order is deterministic and consistent across restarts.

### âœ… 6. **Consistency Across Multiple Workers**

* [x] Route traffic for a given domain/path to the same Durable Object (e.g., via `.get(id)` keyed by hostname or route).
* [x] Ensure Durable Object doesn't become a bottleneck (use per-route or per-user affinity when needed).

### âœ… 7. **Timeouts & Retries (Logical Handling)**

* [x] Handle upstream timeouts gracefully and retry next backend (configurable max retry count).
* [x] Avoid retrying non-idempotent methods unless explicitly allowed.
* [x] Support configurable per-backend timeouts.

### âœ… 8. **Observability Support**

* [x] Expose metadata in response headers for debugging (e.g., `X-Backend-Used`).
* [x] Optionally log requestâ†’backend mappings (ideally via queue or log stream to avoid blocking).

### âœ… 9. **Graceful Failover**

* [x] If selected backend is down/unreachable, skip to the next (and preserve index state).
* [x] Track temporary backend failures (without health checks) using request failures.
